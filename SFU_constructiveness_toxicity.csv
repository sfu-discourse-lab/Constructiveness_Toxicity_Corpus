Personally, I think there's a number of things going on. Pope Francis is doing a great PR job for the church without really deviating from the Church's overall theological position. The church needs some recharging, and he's doing his best to provide it without deviating from core theology. He was a priest and bishop in South America, and saw a kind of poverty there that few popes (all Europeans, and until recently, all from Italy) have ever seen. Christianity - for all the focus the Church has placed on these things in the past few decades - was not meant to be about sexual orientation, abortion issues, and other modern day preoccupations. Its original imperative was about love and compassion, with a strong injunction to help the poor, as well as a focus on the life of the spirit versus the material. In focusing on poverty and questioning the rampant materialism of the modern age, he's going back to the roots of the religion (sadly mostly lost in the last 2000 years). As for environmentalism, why not? This I think is part of the great PR he's doing, there's nothing controversial about it from the Church's perspective, and it's a very hot topic these days.

They have been ordaining women as priests for twenty years now, along with other Provinces of the Anglican Communion, and now the number of women in theological colleges preparing for ordination are well outnumbering men.  The result being that men are leaving the church in droves.  In addition to this women are getting all the senior appointments, and come from a background of, in many cases, militant feminism.

Well, Apple has stopped making them. Think about it: they made something that did just one thing and did it brilliantly, allowing users to store an incredible amount of music in a small portable device, but now that's gone, as they try to sell us on other gadgets that yes, will store music, but only a fraction of what the Classic could hold.

Then came the disruptions to the status quo.The arts have suffered dreadfully. Recent reports show incomes for musicians, writers, and artists are way down from a decade ago. But the Tech Rebels scoff at this and call us to look to the Brave New World of Free Information, Art, and Music.One might ask where those who once were paid to write and sing will find money to eat, but that just makes you a reactionary and a counter-revolutionary. Food can now be printed on one's 3-D printer, says the Comrade of Tech.I'm tempted to scoff, 'Let them eat Bits &amp; Bytes', but that is a trademarked name.I listened to Douglas Coupland, who is sounding like a tech party hack more and more, talk about not being able to remember what it was like to not have the Internet. He has a Wired Brain now. And he offered an anecdote to prove it, only the anecdote proved to be vague and flat and unpersuasive (like everything Mr Coupland has written after Generation X).My library has ditched half its collection in the past two years in the naive belief we'll soon be fully digital and want to be fully digital.

",FALSE,"Uber drivers have filed a class action lawsuit claiming they have been misclassified as independent contractors and are entitled to be reimbursed for their expenses that Uber should have to pay, like for gas and vehicle maintenance. The lawsuit also challenges Uber’s practice of telling passengers that the gratuity is included and not to tip the drivers, even though you are not getting a tip!!We won a major victory on March 11, 2015, when the judge overseeing the case, Judge Edward M. Chen, of the federal district court in San Francisco, denied Uber’s motion for summary judgment!  In his decision, the judge agreed with many of our arguments about why Uber drivers may be properly classified as employees.  Click here to read the court’s decision.  Under the court’s order, the case will go to trial before a jury.  See the news stories below for reports on the ruling.The next step in the case will now be for the court to decide class certification, which would define the scope of the case and which drivers can be covered under it. The court has set a hearing on class certification for August 6, 2015.  We expect that Uber will argue that most drivers are bound by an arbitration clause, which prevents them from benefiting from a class action case in court.  In another case (which challenges Uber’s background checks), the same judge who is presiding over our case ruled that Uber’s arbitration clause is unconscionable and unenforceable.  However, Uber has appealed that decision.  In the event that the arbitration clause is ultimately enforced, we plan to file individual arbitration cases for drivers who may be bound by the arbitration clause. So if you did not opt out of Uber's arbitration clause within 30 days of accepting the agreement (and most drivers did not), please CONTACT US so that we can add you to our list of drivers to pursue individual arbitration if we need to do that, so that you can be assured of being covered by the result we obtain.  If you accepted an Uber contract within the last 30 days, you can still opt out of the arbitration clause by emailing optout@uber.com and saying you want to opt out of the arbitration clause.  IN OTHER WORDS, EVEN IF WE WIN THE CASE, YOU MAY NOT RECOVER ANYTHING FROM IT UNLESS YOU CONTACT US TO SIGN UP FOR ARBITRATION.  SO PLEASE EMAIL ELIZABETH LOPEZ, AT elopez@llrlaw.com, TO SIGN UP FOR ARBITRATION, IN THE EVENT THAT WE NEED TO FILE INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS FOR DRIVERS.  MORE THAN A THOUSAND DRIVERS FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY HAVE ALREADY CONTACTED US TO JOIN OUR LIST.In a recent decision, the California Labor Commissioner ruled that an Uber driver was indeed an employee, not an independent contractor, and ordered Uber to reimburse the driver for her expenses.  This is the same remedy we are seeking for all Uber drivers in the class action lawsuit.  This decision was a great result and may be helpful to our lawsuit.  We were very pleased to learn that the California Labor Commissioner agrees that Uber is acting as an employer.  However, Uber has appealed the decision, which will be reviewed de novo in court, and so its impact on the class action case is not yet clear.We filed this case on behalf of Uber drivers across the country.  In an early ruling, the court agreed with us that the case could proceed on behalf of drivers nationwide.  In a later ruling, however, the judge changed his mind and limited the case to drivers in California. We think this decision was incorrect and we plan to appeal it. But meanwhile, if you have driven for Uber anywhere in the United States, and did not opt out of the arbitration clause within 30 days of accepting Uber’s licensing agreement, PLEASE CONTACT US to obtain a form to return to us so that we can pursue an individual arbitration claim for you, in the event that we have to pursue these claims individually, rather than through the class action.If you have any questions, feel free to call or email Shannon Liss-Riordan, the lead attorney representing the Uber drivers, or her paralegal assistant, Elizabeth Lopez, at (617) 994-5800, at elopez@llrlaw.com, or sliss@llrlaw.com.Attorney Liss-Riordan and her firm have represented thousands of tipped employees, and employees who have been misclassified as independent contractors, all around the country.

A dispute between China, Taiwan, Vietnam and others on the extent of their respective sovereignty in the S. China Sea dates back to end of WW2, but originated around 1900. It's been a century of on/off squabbles, their own affairs. But when Hillary became SoS a few years ago she proclaimed with great hubris Asia Pivot! What this means is the U.S. will install massive military forces in the region to contain & control China. And thus the Obama regime inserted itself into this century old affair, made it America's business, to cover the real goal of Asia domination. To meddle in this adventure and see what come out of it just like Syria. And if its war so much the better. The design is classic but most evil. Nobody like to be 'contained' and China responded. [I like to see America being 'contained' one day and enjoy to see how it jumps and cries like a bullied child.]The so-called Tribunal is not a UN-sponsored body. It is just an opinion body in a far away European country with absolutely no court power. It deals only with economic matters, not politics or border. Philippines previous president asked it to pass an opinion on the matter of Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), not border or sovereignty. Specifically, what size of an island qualified for EEZ. The Tribunal reports that NO island or sandbar or reclaimed islands currently in the SCS qualify for EEZ. It also defined what size will qualify. That's it. No islands built or claimed by all parties - China, Taiwan, Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia is an EEZ and therefore not a basis for border. That's the opinion for this body. The meaning is simply that they can build bigger islands to fit the EEZ definition, or just go sit down and work out a border solution. China is willing to talk but not with the U.S. inserting itself in the matter. The new Philippine president agreed and they will begin the talk. Once they formed a framework others may join to effect a solution. This of course is very bad news for American war mongers and Asian Pivoters.

It is just an opinion body in a far away European country with absolutely no court power. It deals only with economic matters, not politics or border. Philippines previous president asked it to pass an opinion on the matter of Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), not border or sovereignty. Specifically, what size of an island qualified for EEZ. The Tribunal reports that NO island or sandbar or reclaimed islands currently in the SCS qualify for EEZ. It also defined what size will qualify. That's it.No islands built or claimed by all parties - China, Taiwan, Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia is an EEZ and therefore not a basis for border. That's the opinion for this body.The meaning is simply that they can build bigger islands to fit the EEZ definition, or just go sit down and work out a border solution. China is willing to talk but not with the U.S. inserting itself in the matter. The new Philippine president agreed and they will begin the talk. Once they formed a framework others may join to effect a solution.This of course is very bad news for American war mongers and Asian Pivoters.

In short, Brussels is the shining light of left-wing big government.  And yet all of this government cannot protect its citizens from terrorist attacks.  The politicians and bureaucrats will deny responsibility while claiming that they need more money (i.e., higher taxes) to fund improved security.  The reality, however, is misplaced priorities and too much money spent by bureaucrats on activities that are unproductive and unimportant. Protecting the safety and security of citizens is arguably the highest priority of a democratic government  and that is where government resources should be redirected.",,http://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/why-belgium-is-ground-zero-for-jihadi-terrorism/article29425530/,,,,Why Belgium is ground zero for jihadi terrorism,http://www.sfu.ca/content/dam/sfu/discourse-lab/globe/belgium.html,

So I stood there in the rain, yelling at the man who had assaulted the young girl and he told me to mind my own business and go away.  From my perspective, no amount of money will make the problem of abuse of young girls go away until the attitude on the reserves changes. Last week there was an article in the Globe titled 'The best native leader Canada never had.' It profiled Chief Clarence Louie of the Osoyoos band. Unless there has been no residential school abuse of his band, what is the difference between his band and all the other bands?  It seems it is a lack of leadership. Yes, I want this awful abuse to stop happening, but throwing more money at the problem doesn't seem to be the answer.  It has to be a change of culture within each individual band. I've met some really strong native women who know what needs to be done, but they are being undermined by a bad, sexist culture on the reserves. Tossing dollars at the problem won't help.

Moore sees Trump's supporters as decent people who have legitimate problems that are not being addressed, and attacking them as backwards deplorable irredeemable was the worse strategy possible.But what did the progressives do?  They said only stupid racist hateful people support Trump.   It was almost like Trump successfully pulled off an Alinsky tactic by baiting the establishment progressives into overreacting and making his supporters even more convinced that he was going to blow the whole place up.I think Moore's plan was difficult to pull off because neither Hillary nor Moore or just about anyone else had the ability to connect to the rust belt and hurting 'deplorables' the same way Trump could --- it's all about people skills.Besides, there was no way Clinton could say that if Ford wanted to move their factory to mexico, she would slap a 35% tarriff when they ship the cars back to the US --- no way Wall Street could tolerate that.

",FALSE, Last week I posted that Donald Trump had a distinct possibility of winning the US election as this was in essence a Brexit USA style vote and the pollsters and media pundits had it wrong. I got the second highest up plus vote on the day on the G&M. For six months I have been saying that the people I knew in the USA felt a distinct disconnect with DC just like the UK had with Brussels.  The know it all Liberal Democrats are and were out of touch with the general populace of the 'flyover states' and Main Street USA has spoken. In recent days Obama showed his true colours as an out of touch president who tied his legacy coat tails to a nominee who was flawed in the publics view. Thursday morning will be an interesting meeting at the Whitehouse with Trump viewing the new real estate. I know many businessmen who have had past dealings with Trump and his word is his bond in their words and he is a stand up guy.  He will surround himself with advent professionals and will most likely be a great president. His acceptance speech shows that he will now be a committed bridge maker.  Chuck Todd of NBC was the only guy last night that got it early last night and spoke about a massive un polled demographic.  I look forward to seeing CNNs lead pollster eat a bug on TV today like he said he would if Trump won.  Maybe some of these guys should move their offices west of the Hudson to where real people live as Chuck Todd said last night.  I have to say that Trudeau showed well thought restraint in not saying anything negative about Trump and there are lots of world leaders in Europe that will have to back track on their public comments.  He may not be a great president for Canada but that is not his job.  W5 on the weekend showed a great man in the street USA Divided show and it was great journalism diving head long into parts of Ohio that most journalists did not tried.  I had several of my close friends and family watch that show.   I wish Trump and his family the very best for what will be a trying time now that the real difficult work begins.  ,,http://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/editorials/what-donald-trumps-victory-means-for-canada-and-the-world/article32746841/,,,,What Donald Trump's victory means for Canada and the world - The Globe and Mail,http://www.sfu.ca/content/dam/sfu/discourse-lab/globe/trump.html,

That means returning all the revenue to individuals and corporations  in the form of reduced taxes, including corporate taxes and regulatory costs, to maintain competitiveness.  That's what economists who proposed carbon taxes  originally had in mind, rather than treating carbon taxes as a big sin tax that goes into general revenues for addressing deficits and paying for pet projects, as our governments tend to regard them. Otherwise, we jeopardize Canadian competitiveness and prosperity. Arrogantly and contemptuously dismissing these concerns as not worthy of consideration in comparison to the fate of the earth or whatever will just increase the likelihood of Canada producing  its own Trump three or four years from now. For the long term, we need not only to defend the Canada-US free trade agreement, even if it is modified in some way, but to expand our trade connections with other countries. CETA is a good start. However it is also important to grow our own internal market. That means eliminating interprovincial barriers to trade in goods and services. Here Mr Trudeau needs to start knocking some provincial premier heads. And it means increasing Canada's population. The advantage of increased population, so long as it is a productive population that isn't just an overall drain on resources, is that it increases the internal market and makes it less susceptible to the inevitable vicissitudes of foreign trade and isolationist eruptions elsewhere. That's a great advantage the United States and Europe have and Canada lacks. Faced with a situation like Mr Trump's victory, Mr Chretien and Mr Martin would have sat down for some blunt conversations with members of their own party and provincial counterparts , as they did concerning the implications of the deficit for Canadian prosperity.

My father and uncles, all went to war in WWII to protect that right for all of us today. Most people, in both Canada and the US, have family members who did the same, and some who made the ultimate sacrifice. That America exercised that right yesterday, and other democratic countries have done the same in the past (I am not a fan of Junior Trudeau) is our best strength. As Winston Churchill famously said, “Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others.”. None of us have an idea how a Trump Presidency will turn out; but the inescapable fact of the matter is that every American, who wanted to exercise their franchise, had the opportunity yesterday to decide who their President is. It wasn’t all that long ago (Aug 6, 1965), that a guy who many people might have expected wouldn’t support universal suffrage, Lyndon Baines Johnson, passed into law for the US, the Voting Rights Act. In 4 years, if they don’t like his performance, they get to kick Trump out of office. In the meantime, everyone who thinks they are “politically entitled” in the US has a chance to rebuild their favourite system. Just as Lech Walesa upset the communist system in Poland, so today has Donald Trump upset the system of political elites in the USA. This is healthy; this is growth; and this will keep America as the leader of the free world. For a country born of revolution, they have nothing to fear. God bless the United States of America.

Poor Greece has been inundated with refugees that can't afford to help. Germany accepted 140,000 refugees in 2015 (not just Syrian), Italy and Sweden 30,000 each, France 20,000. Small Denmark was swamped with 20,000 refugee applications. Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and even Egypt and Iraq have been helping the refugees since the beginning of the crisis (2011). For the most part they permitted Syrians access to their countries and have spent vast amounts of money to support them - some published numbers include Turkey, by the start of December 2014, spent USD 4.5 billion in direct assistance to Syrian and as of mid-2014, tiny Jordan and Lebanon had provided more than US$ 1.2 billion and 1.6 billion respectively.Many refugees are not interested in leaving the region. Millions want to return home once the war is over and would prefer to stay close to home - little interest was shown in immigrating to Canada when they were questioned last year.And as for complaints by the author that 'More than 1,000 of the newcomers are living in temporary housing. And we still have a shortage of family doctors, a lack of proper dental care for low-income adults and a lack of subsidized daycare spaces for parents who want to learn English'. How does that differ from the plight faced by many Canadians? Should refugees be somehow afforded a higher priority than citizens?And the comment 'University-age refugees, or those who already have foreign degrees, can't afford our postsecondary system, sending many to low-income jobs instead. What future do refugees have without proper language training, Canadian education or Canadian work experience' pretty much sums up why the refugees don't want to come to Canada or complain when they get here.

Important facts are omitted or skewed in the interest of artificially supporting the author’s point and logic fails.“Europe has failed the refugees”....really. Poor Greece has been inundated with refugees that can't afford to help. Germany accepted 140,000 refugees in 2015 (not just Syrian), Italy and Sweden 30,000 each, France 20,000. Small Denmark was swamped with 20,000 refugee applications.  Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and even Egypt and Iraq have been helping the refugees since the beginning of the crisis (2011).  For the most part they permitted Syrians access to their countries and have spent vast amounts of money to support them  - some published numbers include Turkey, by the start of December 2014, spent USD 4.5 billion in direct assistance to Syrian  and as of mid-2014, tiny Jordan and Lebanon had provided more than US$ 1.2 billion and 1.6 billion respectively.Many refugees are not interested in leaving the region. Millions want to return home once the war is over and would prefer to stay close to home - little interest was shown in immigrating to Canada when they were questioned last year.And as for complaints by the author that  “More than 1,000 of the newcomers are living in temporary housing. And we still have a shortage of family doctors, a lack of proper dental care for low-income adults and a lack of subsidized daycare spaces for parents who want to learn English”. How does that differ from the plight faced by many Canadians? Should refugees be somehow afforded a higher priority than citizens?  And the comment “University-age refugees, or those who already have foreign degrees, can’t afford our postsecondary system, sending many to low-income jobs instead. What future do refugees have without proper language training, Canadian education or Canadian work experience” pretty much sums up why the refugees don’t want to come to Canada or complain when they get here.  Resettlement of refugees is a complex, time consuming undertaking  and resource intensive. How is Canada supposed to magically change this experience? It is easy to put these complaints to paper but I see not solutions proposed – and that is the hard part.",,http://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/europe-may-be-failing-syrian-refugees-but-canada-shouldnt-boast-yet/article29265806/,,,,"Europe may be failing Syrian refugees, but Canada shouldn't boast yet - The Globe and Mail",http://www.sfu.ca/content/dam/sfu/discourse-lab/globe/refugees.html,

An earlier article referred to the new generation of refugees being born in birthing tents along the route to Europe -- parents aren't planning for the future of their own children when they continue to produce more and more of them as they move from crowded refugee camp to another. Rouba Al-Fattal should look at the huge increases in populations in the Middle East and take note of where most of the civil wars are taking place ... in nations where the population has tripled or quadrupled since the 1980s.  Huge numbers of people are fighting over territory, though they pretend it has something to do with religion.Nowhere on earth can millions of people cross an isthmus to existing host towns ... where they do not share the values of the hosts ... and demand to be taken in at the expense of the hosts. Demand housing, demand health & dental care, demand education, demand recognition for credentials at face value, demand childcare ... who is paying for all this? Hint: not the refugees.This is a smack in the face to all Canadians, particularly those who never thought it was a good idea to bring these huge families to Canada, preferring to send those funds (for flights to Canada and costly accommodation here) to refugee settlements in Jordan and other zones close to Syria.  Instead, we hear more and more demands without any recognition for all the associated costs.  Even Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf States do NOT accept refugees, even though they are member states of the UN.I suspect it is this pushy demanding attitude that leads to problems in the Middle East, along with the unsustainable growth in population. Canada has a high unemployment rate and is the participant (usually the victim) in many free trade deals.

He makes NO mention of China's very restrictive land ownership policies, something that is done to protect real estate for domestic citizens ... and no one calls China 'racist' for doing that.

Canada is not perfect, but it is probably one of the least racist nations ... except when it comes to First Nations who tend to have been restricted by government decree until recent years.The following article from 2013 tells us that more than half of Toronto's population is NON-white (the target of authors who favour a 'race lens') -- same in Vancouver?: http://www.canadianbusiness.com/blogs-and-comment/a-fascinating-new-map-of-torontos-ethnic-distribution/ It also identifies the primary source countries for immigration as the Philippines, India, and China.

White is the true minority colour in this global human mix.Canada receives large numbers of immigrants from homogeneous nations where being white is a rarity; yet, Canada is home to a very mixed population of 35,939,000. Within the context of world populations (particularly immigrant source nations), the number of 'white' people is miniscule.Many parts of Canada are trying to 'resemble' the populations of the entire world. Yet, NOWHERE ELSE in the world does that happen. Immigrant source nations are certainly NOT trying to resemble Canada, or attract 'white' people because they feel they MUST be more 'diverse', though 'Homo sapiens sapiens' simply describes the entire human race as ONE single species.

Many parts of Canada are trying to 'resemble' the populations of the entire world. Yet, NOWHERE ELSE in the world does that happen.

However,from my reading of it, being female had little to do with it.  For my part I think its just as much a case of Obama failure as anything.  That 'hope and change' really didn't materialize.      But the US is highly divided.  You can see that in the voting patterns of citizens initiatives.  In Maine virtually every citizen initiative was divided almost fifty fifty.  Want legal marijuana?  Just barely over half do.  A bond initiative for public transportation? DItto.  Increased taxes for public education, 51%.      Its not a coincidence that virtually every presidential election is decided within 8 percentage points, and thats no matter WHO runs.     But I have to say,  I do a lot of volunteer work, and most of the heavy lifting is done by women.

What I did not like about Clinton the sense I got from her of 'entitlement', that the office was hers for the taking - and not just from her days as Secretary of State, or as a Senator, or from having been First Lady - it struck me, watching a documentary about the US presidential candidates that Clinton had her eyes set on 'the Office' from the time that she had been profiled in LIFE magazine at her College graduation. That uniquely American sense of 'Manifest Destiny' is not attractive - particularly when someone's asking for your help to achieve it. Now that's just my perception, but I believe that same arrogance was what led her (and her team) not to worry about the signals they'd received that they could lose votes in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. Those states were lost by the thinnest of margins, and still, as it has been pointed out, Clinton won the popular vote.   I felt that the 'feminist icon' trope was also odd, like a relic from a previous generation. I'm a man, working in a traditional male field (engineering) but I've always accepted and supported my female colleagues and managers. I will agree that the bemused tolerance of the masses was too easily interpreted as tacit approval of Trump's antics, until it was too late. I also agree that groups of people whose attitudes and behaviour sequestered them (rightfully) to an underclass in our society, have been emboldened. I doubt that they will remain that way for long. Nothing that Donald Trump can do will elevate these fools, or make their angry lives truly better.

",FALSE,"While your conclusion that Ms. Clinton lost the election because she is a woman may be valid, I think you're over-distilling a complex set of issues into a simple gender issue.  Remember, Mr. Trump chewed his way through 16 other Republican contenders, most of them men, and probably all of them technically more qualified than he. Much of that spectacle occurred long before it was evident that Ms. Clinton would be the Democratic nominee. You assume, incorrectly, that America is a progressive society. While there are progressive segments, what this election demonstrated is the opposite.  Sexism, racism and xenophobia are alive and doing very well there, particlarly in the Republican caucus. Further, politics is relentlessly self-serving, at the personal and party level. Also, especially since 2008, economic growth has disproportionately benefitted the wealthy. (That's a big issue on its own, but its relevance here is that the privileged are making the economic and political decisions to their own benefit while the underclass is falling farther behind.) For example, how can America's election campaign funding model be considered fair and democratic?  Mr. Trump has ably exploited all these issues. Ms. Clinton, besides being a woman, also became the poster-person for the status quo. In effect her biggest asset - her vast experience - became a liability.  Perhaps Bernie Sanders would have been a better adversary, not because he's a guy, but because he also was speaking out about the injustices being suffered by less privileged Americans.  Those arguments worked very well for his popularity too, particularly among young women.  And, since we're here, Ms. Clinton wasn't so overwhelmingly popular among those younger women. While one can argue with some validity that some women are against a female President, I'd venture that for many of them, other issues are in play.While it is fair to speak out against sexism (and racism and xenophobia) in America and elsewhere, my worry now is that Americans have elected a sorcerer's apprentice. How much damage can this apprentice do?  I worry about increasing instability in eastern Europe (in particular).  I worry about war over the South China Sea.I worry that the global ecosphere is in deeper trouble now, due to Mr Trump's inappropriate policies on climate change, habitat destruction and unsustainable, profit-driven, wasteful consumption of resources.
